# Amusement Park Tracker

The application will allow users to navigate through a list of parks. Users will also be able to create, read, update, and delete parks (CRUD features). This project is divided into two portions: building out pages related to parks and building out pages related to park attractions. As a bonus, you will autonomously build the features related to park attractions.
